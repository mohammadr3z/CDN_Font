No traffic limits or throttling. Files are served via CloudFlare's CDN.

Files are automatically optimized.

Use a specific tag or commit hash in the URL (not a branch). Files are cached permanently based on the URL. Query strings are ignored.

The catch: this is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees.
